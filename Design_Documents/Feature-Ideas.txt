FEATURE IDEAS

- Removing Verse #'s
	- when trying to determine the verses to remove, it'll likely start at verse 1 (except for some unique cases, such as Mark/John where it mentions these verses weren't in original manuscripts and thus a new chapter may start w/the following number of the last verse in the last chapter). Starting with 1 (v.1) index through the entire chapter to search for the next subsuquent #, should  improve the odds of removing ONLY verse #'s instead of accidentially removing #'s that aren't verses.
	- This isn't 100% error proof, perhaps a more robust method could use an AI/library that'd read the words before/after a # to see if it gives indication that it's about to mention a # and if it does, then leave it be and perhaps notify the user "we detected _this_number_ in this sentence and left it based on context."
	
- Removing Chapter Headings
	- perhaps the easiest way for this would be to look at the html for the text in the website and see if it differs from the "body" of the text and if it does and IF the user wants the chapter headings removed then go ahead and delete them. 
	- Or if they want to keep them perhaps have a table that stores the location of the header (like after these 3x words and before these 3x words) and then i know the location of the header and could paste it in with unique spacing before/after to help differentiate it from the "body" of the text
